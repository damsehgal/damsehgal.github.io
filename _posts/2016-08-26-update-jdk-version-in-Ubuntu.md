#Oracle JDK 8#
This is the latest stable version of Java at time of writing, and the recommended version to install. You can do so using the following command:
	<code>sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer</code>
#Managing Java#
There can be multiple Java installations on one computer . You can configure which version is the default for use in the command line by using update-alternatives, which manages symlinks used for different commands.
<code>sudo update-alternatives --config java</code>
after running this command you will have a screen similar to this

There are 5 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).
